# Intel IoT Examples Datastore

## Introduction

The Intel IoT Examples Datastore is intended to provide a simple data store for sample applications that are part of the Intel IoT Starter Kit examples.

It is a Node.js* application written using Express* ([https://github.com/strongloop/express](https://github.com/strongloop/express)). It uses a Redis* ([http://redis.io](http://redis.io)) data store.

Although this data storage application is developed to deploy on Microsoft* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or Amazon Web Services* (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk*, since it is based on commonly used open-source modules, it should be easy to deploy on many different cloud hosts.

## How it works

The Intel IoT Examples Datastore application provides a simple REST API that allows authorized callers to store either log data or incremental counter data.

It exposes two sets of routes, both using basic token authentication.

To authorize, provide the `AUTH_TOKEN` you set in the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header.

Multiple clients can share the same Intel IoT Examples Datastore by simply using a different route key for each application.

### Counter

The counter routes are used to increment an increasing counter.

- `GET /counter/:key` - gets the current value of a counter
- `GET /counter/:key/inc` - increments a counter by 1

### Logger

The logger routes wrap Redis* lists, and are used to keep a linear backlog of values.

- `GET /logger/:key` - gets the latest value of a log
- `PUT /logger/:key` - adds a value to a log (`value` parameter in the POST body)
- `GET /logger/:key/all` - returns all values of a log

## Local setup

To install the application dependencies, use the following command:

    $ npm install

You also need to have Redis* installed.
For more information, see the Redis* download page:

<a href="http://redis.io/download">http://redis.io/download</a>

## Configuration

Primary configuration for the application takes the form of the following `ENV` variables:

- `REDIS_URL` - the URL to use for Redis* communication
- `REDIS_AUTH` - authentication token for the Redis* backend
- `PORT` - port to serve the application on (defaults to `3000`)
- `AUTH_TOKEN` - authentication token for clients to use

## Deployment - Microsoft* Azure*

This guide covers setting up a deployment environment for the Intel IoT Examples Datastore on Microsoft* Azure*.

For other platforms, refer to the platform documentation.

Before we begin, ensure you have a Microsoft* Azure* account:

10. In the directory you're using for this repository, use the command line to run the following Git* command that adds a Microsoft* Azure* server for deployment:

        git remote add azure <GitURL>

where `<gitURL>` is the value you obtained from the **Git URL** field on the **Properties** page.

Now you are ready to deploy the application. Run the following Git* command:

    git push azure master

You are prompted for the password you entered under **Deployment credentials**.

## Deployment - AWS* Elastic Beanstalk*

This guide covers setting up a deployment environment for the Intel IoT Examples Datastore on AWS* using Elastic Beanstalk*.

For other platforms, refer to the platform documentation.

Before we begin, please ensure you have an AWS* account:

[http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/)

### Install the AWS* Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI*) tools

To deploy the Intel IoT Examples Datastore on AWS* using Elastic Beanstalk*, you must first install the EB CLI\* tools as explained below:

[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)

### Create a new web application

In the directory you're using for this repository, use the command line to run the following EB CLI* command that creates a new AWS* application:

    eb init

When prompted for the Elastic Beanstalk* region, enter the number of the region you wish, or choose the default.

When prompted for the Elastic Beanstalk* application to use, enter the number corresponding to the  **Create new Application** option.

When prompted, enter **y** if you want to set up an SSH connection to your instances. Enter **n** if you do not want to set up an SSH connection.

### Deploy your web application

Now, you can create your running environment by entering the following command:

    eb create

When prompted for the Elastic Beanstalk* environment name, enter the name of the environment. If you want to accept the default, press **Enter**.

When prompted for a CNAME prefix, enter the CNAME prefix you want to use. If you want to accept the default, press **Enter**.

### Configure your web application

Most of the configuration settings are automatically determined by the Intel IoT Examples Datastore application itself when running under AWS* Elastic Beanstalk*. To set `AUTH_TOKEN`, enter the following command:

    eb setenv AUTH_TOKEN=<your token>

where `<your token>` is your actual authorization token.
